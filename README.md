# Taskman

Taskman is the simply helpful task manager app with minimal features, so that users can focus on managing their workload for the day. The sleek, minimal design ensures there are no distractions - nothing pretty to look at, no affiliate marketing and distracting ads. It does one thing and one thing only - Creates, Reads, Updates, and Deletes tasks. When you need a full CRUD todo, taskman is here for you.

## Technologies

Taskman is built with MongoDB, ExpressJS, and React, and NodeJs. It's full stack and reliable.

### Getting Started

Would you like to try Taskman? It's free and always will be. Just click the link and conquer your day: https://taskman-1osa.onrender.com

### Unsolved Problems

At Taskman, we're always improving, and part of improving is being honest with issues. One of those issues is clicking 'add task' with an empty field will add an empty task to the task list. This is a simple enough fix which will be implemented in future versions.

### Future Enhancements

Taskman has a ton of potential. One way we intend to improve Taskman is by having a drag and drop feature similar to trello, as well as multiple task lists for each day of the week. A gentle alarm feature would be helpful as well, for those who like to work in time intervals before taking short breaks. Darkmode is another feature we strive to implement here at Taskman.
